# On-Premises Intelligence – Persistent Storage

This directory holds runtime artefacts generated by the application:

• **faiss.index** – vector index storing dense embeddings for similarity search.
• **metadata.db** – SQLite database with chunk metadata (id, filename, etc.).

These files are created automatically the first time you ingest a document.

⚠️ **Do NOT delete or commit these binary files** unless you intentionally want to reset the database. Removing them will wipe your vector store and all retrieval capability.
