# On-Premises Intelligence (OPI) - find and chat though your personal documents

**Local, private Retrieval-Augmented Generation for personal data analysis.**

Imagine having a smart assistant that *could* comb through your private collection of documents — anything from confidential contracts to specialised medical guidelines or complex tax records. By keeping everything on **your own machine**, OPI is designed to index those files securely and let you ask plain-English questions such as *"Which clause covers early termination?"* or *"What's the deductible for procedure 99214?"*. It then attempts to surface the most relevant passages and draft a concise answer — all **without sending any data to the cloud**. Potential benefits:

* **Privacy by default** – sensitive data never leaves your firewall.
* **Faster insight** – cut hours of scrolling through PDFs down to seconds.
* **Domain flexibility** – use for legal, financial, medical, engineering and other private documents.
